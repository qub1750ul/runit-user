= RUnit-user
A reimplementation of the Runit service management suite for use in user sessions
:toc:

== Why
RUnit is a product truly adherent to the KISS philosophy. +
Unfortunately KISS not necessarily equals flexibility or configurability. +
In fact RUnit presents some inflexibilities that makes it not suitable
for user session usage as is.

Runit-user aims to solve these problems while keeping differences from the
original as little as possible, with few exceptions.

== Building
